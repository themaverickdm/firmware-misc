This is a modified WAVLINK_WN586X3-A_M86X3A_V240113_WO-GDBYFM.bin image from
Wavlink for WL-WN586X3 v1.

The changes are as follows:
1) Enable failsafe mode. Failsafe wait time is 60s.
2) Enable dropbear (sshd).
3) Always run firstboot so that any previous settings are not carried forward,
   espcially related to users and passwords.
4) root password is admin123.
